# Sub of the Day

## Overview
The page dynamically displays the sub of the day from Mr. Sub based on the current day of the week.

## Project Idea and Learning
- I have had a few subs recently, so while learning Node.js and Express.js, I thought it would be a neat idea to use the simple Date object from JavaScript to display the sub of the day menu special from Mr. Sub. 
- The page looks simple enough on the frontend, but all the logic runs on the backend using Node.js. I got a chance to start using Embedded JavaScript Templating (EJS), particularly the Tags to get started. 

## Technology
